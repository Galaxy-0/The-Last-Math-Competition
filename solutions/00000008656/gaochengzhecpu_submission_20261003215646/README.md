# Conjecture 00000008656: Disproof

In the rank-two free group F(a,b), a and a inverse are distinct reduced words of length 1 in the same automorphism orbit. No automorphism can send a nonidentity element to the identity, so no word in that orbit has length 0. Both words are therefore global minima. Lean constructs the free group from all signed words, proves its universal property, and quantifies over all automorphisms and all word representatives.

## Scope

This refutes the literal unique-minimum-representative clause. The source supplies neither identification under signed basis permutations nor a canonical tie-breaking rule. The result makes no claim about uniqueness after adding such a rule or about the separate complexity clauses.

## Contents and reproduction

- `main.tex` and `main.pdf`: full argument, stated scope, and formalization bridge.
- `lean/`: complete Lean 4.19.0 project using bundled Std only.
- `conjecture.md`: exact upstream bilingual statement; `SOURCE.md` and `AUTHOR_NOTES.md` preserve source and author notes.
- `verification/`: actual build logs, original author records, PDF checks, and independent review.
- `VALIDATION.json`: authoritative SHA-256 hashes for the files in this submission.

With Lean 4.19.0 installed, run from `lean/`:

```text
lake build
lake env lean -DwarningAsError=true Main.lean
```

Compile `main.tex` with Tectonic or a standard LaTeX distribution. Any auxiliary Python source used in the argument is included in this directory. The Lean source, project configuration, LaTeX source, and PDF are byte-identical to the independently reviewed local release. The PDF was compiled and all pages were visually inspected.

Original author records describe earlier validation stages and may contain pre-layout manuscript hashes or earlier pending/publication statuses. Their historical fields are preserved; `VALIDATION.json` contains current file hashes. They do not supersede the final independent review or PDF validation.
