# Conjecture 00000006330: Proof

The integer matrices diag(1,4) and diag(2,2) both have determinant 4 and permanent 4, but are inequivalent under unimodular row transformations. In fact, any integer matrix product U diag(2,2) V has only even entries, so it cannot equal diag(1,4). This also excludes two-sided unimodular equivalence.

## Scope

The example proves the requested existence statement using the source's explicit unimodular-row interpretation of integer type. The formal obstruction quantifies over arbitrary integer transformation matrices, rather than a bounded search.

## Contents and reproduction

- `main.tex` and `main.pdf`: full argument, stated scope, and formalization bridge.
- `lean/`: complete Lean 4.19.0 project using bundled Std only.
- `conjecture.md`: exact upstream bilingual statement; `SOURCE.md` and `AUTHOR_NOTES.md` preserve source and author notes.
- `verification/`: actual build logs, original author records, PDF checks, and independent review.
- `VALIDATION.json`: authoritative SHA-256 hashes for the files in this submission.

With Lean 4.19.0 installed, run from `lean/`:

```text
lake build
lake env lean -DwarningAsError=true Main.lean
```

Compile `main.tex` with Tectonic or a standard LaTeX distribution. Any auxiliary Python source used in the argument is included in this directory. The Lean source, project configuration, LaTeX source, and PDF are byte-identical to the independently reviewed local release. The PDF was compiled and all pages were visually inspected.

Original author records describe earlier validation stages and may contain pre-layout manuscript hashes or earlier pending/publication statuses. Their historical fields are preserved; `VALIDATION.json` contains current file hashes. They do not supersede the final independent review or PDF validation.
