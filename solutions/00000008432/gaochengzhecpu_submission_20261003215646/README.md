# Conjecture 00000008432: Disproof

The binary [7,3,4] simplex code has seven minimum-weight supports forming a 2-(7,4,2) design of exact strength 2. Every support has four coordinates, so their hypergraph has rank 4 rather than t+1=3. The proof verifies the linear code, the complete minimum-support family, every pair incidence, and unequal triple incidences.

## Scope

This refutes the support-design rank clause using the standard hypergraph rank, namely maximum edge cardinality. The design strength is genuinely 2, so the counterexample does not depend on choosing a weaker t for a stronger design.

## Contents and reproduction

- `main.tex` and `main.pdf`: full argument, stated scope, and formalization bridge.
- `lean/`: complete Lean 4.19.0 project using bundled Std only.
- `conjecture.md`: exact upstream bilingual statement; `SOURCE.md` and `AUTHOR_NOTES.md` preserve source and author notes.
- `verification/`: actual build logs, original author records, PDF checks, and independent review.
- `VALIDATION.json`: authoritative SHA-256 hashes for the files in this submission.

With Lean 4.19.0 installed, run from `lean/`:

```text
lake build
lake env lean -DwarningAsError=true Main.lean
```

Compile `main.tex` with Tectonic or a standard LaTeX distribution. Any auxiliary Python source used in the argument is included in this directory. The Lean source, project configuration, LaTeX source, and PDF are byte-identical to the independently reviewed local release. The PDF was compiled and all pages were visually inspected.

Original author records describe earlier validation stages and may contain pre-layout manuscript hashes or earlier pending/publication statuses. Their historical fields are preserved; `VALIDATION.json` contains current file hashes. They do not supersede the final independent review or PDF validation.
